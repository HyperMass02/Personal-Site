      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am a computer programmer. I am working on making a website that displays different 3d printers and different 3d printing projects
        that I have done along with links for said prints. The point of this website is to have a place to share different types of 3d printer and to leave a review and experience with said printer.
        And also a place to share current projects they are being worked on. And a place to ask for help with problems.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone who has questions or wants to share about 3d printing.</p>  <!-- change this -->

          Ender 3 V2 3D Printer
          The Ender 3 V2 3D Printer is a popular and affordable option in the world of desktop 3D printing, renowned for its reliability, ease of use, and impressive print quality. Built upon the success of its predecessor, the Ender 3, the V2 model introduces several enhancements and upgrades to further elevate the user experience.
          Pros:
          Affordable Price: Priced competitively within the entry-level segment, the Ender 3 V2 offers exceptional value for money, making it accessible to hobbyists, educators, and small businesses.
          Upgraded Features: The V2 model incorporates notable upgrades such as a silent stepper motor, improved filament feeder, and a redesigned user interface, enhancing print quality and overall user experience.
          Open-Source Design: With its open-source design and extensive online community support, the Ender 3 V2 provides users with access to a wealth of resources, including firmware upgrades, troubleshooting guides, and community-driven modifications.
          Reliable Performance: Known for its reliability and consistency, the Ender 3 V2 delivers precise and high-quality prints across a wide range of filament materials and print settings.
          Cons:
          Assembly Required: While assembly is straightforward and well-documented, some users may find the initial setup process time-consuming or intimidating, especially those new to 3D printing.
          Limited Build Volume: With a modest build volume of 220mm x 220mm x 250mm, the Ender 3 V2 may not be suitable for users requiring larger print sizes or scalability.
          Manual Bed Leveling: Unlike more advanced models with automatic bed leveling systems, the Ender 3 V2 requires manual bed leveling, which can be a repetitive task and may require some trial and error to achieve optimal results.
          Despite its minor limitations, the Ender 3 V2 3D Printer remains a popular choice among enthusiasts and beginners alike, offering an excellent balance of affordability, performance, and community support.
